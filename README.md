# N Packages

## Synpopsis
The `n-packages` repo contains recipes on how to build
specific packages in the N Operating system as well as 
packages for other systems

The N Package format is 100% compatible with
the Arch Linux and uses all of the same 
toolkit.

However, in future, N Packages are going to be built 
for all of modern sub-architectures, which will allow
the N Operating System to perform better on certain
CPUs.

The repo contains a script to invoke building of all 
known packages, and resolving dependencies and the order 
of the build.
